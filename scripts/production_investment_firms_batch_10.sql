Since its launch in 2011, Aperam has become an undisputable global player in stainless, electrical, and specialty steel. With a flat stainless and electrical steel production capacity of 2.5 million tonnes in Brazil and Europe, Aperam has customers in over 40 countries. This success is the result of a community of 12,000 employees who are working hard to make Aperam consistently better. Together, the company and its people are embracing sustainable development, a factor that is at the very heart of Aperam''s strategy of providing steel and alloy solutions that are affordable, and long-lasting, and that offers the strength, versatility, and endless recyclability needed to build a sustainable society. With its new Recycling and Renewables segment (BioEnergia, ELG, Recyco), Aperam has put itself at the forefront of the circular economy. In Europe, its production processes use about 90% scrap metal. Aperam is also unique as it is producing charcoal from its own FSC®-certified forestry in Brazil, which is then used in the steel-making process as a natural and renewable substitute for fossil fuels. Today, around 30% of Aperam''s workforce create value from working in Recycling and Renewables upstream. Aperam is also committed to making its products both sustainably and safely. Thanks to efforts like these, which go above and beyond what is required, Aperam''s CO2 footprint ranks as sector leading, and its overall sustainability performance consistently receives top ratings from external analysts..
