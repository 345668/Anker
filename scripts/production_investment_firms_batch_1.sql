This role of digital has strengthened during the economic and social crisis caused by the pandemic and will be crucial for the restart of the global production system. Our recipe is based on a careful selection of talented teams, to whom we will offer capital in increasing quantities and the tools of our “tech workshop”: mentorship, managerial support and access to a large pool of experts.
