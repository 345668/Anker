We believe in true potential and act decisively, investing early and committing deeply. Our approach often spans long-term relationships, with investments sometimes lasting up to 20 years as we support founders in realizing their ambitions. When our bets pay off, we reinvest the proceeds into new funds, demonstrating our commitment to continuous support and growth. As early-stage investors and former founders ourselves, alongside startup operators, engineers, and data scientists, we bring diverse perspectives to every decision. Twice a week, our global teams in New York, Bangalore, Dubai, London, and Paris come together to leverage their local knowledge, discuss trends, and make informed decisions. This collaboration extends not only across our team but also to our exclusive network of entrepreneurs, providing our founders with unparalleled access to diverse insights and opportunities.
