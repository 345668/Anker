Identifying potential transformative leaders is at the core of our strategy, this is why we consider ourselves people investors. We employ a comprehensive evaluation process, made up of a proprietary framework that focuses on the traits of the founders, their tenacity, and their ultimate vision. We learned the hard way that the best founders are those who have a messianic attitude and even believe their venture is fundamental to the world, we discovered on our skin that usually the most successful overcame tough challenges and therefore developed a strong resilience in their past, and they see their company as a revenge to prove to themselves that they are worth it. The more they feel defeated, the heavier they push and the more they are resilient. We want to back the darest, those who have a natural inclination to fail, to take risks, to push the level higher and higher even despite the reality they are forced to face, and the only reason they are doing it is because they feel they have to. Nothing more.

Addington aims at acquiring minority equity positions in startups and scaleups that require funding and targeted support in order to take the next step in their development. Addington’s expertise is highly varied, but best serves companies that offer scalable solutions on a recurring revenue model. Eligible companies ideally have a turnover of € 2 million and the potential to achieve continuous annual growth of 25 percent or higher. Besides funding, Addington provides guidance and advice based on many years of entrepreneurship and experience in international business. Addington holds standards and values that correspond with a genuine family business. To take full advantage of our expertise, a cultural match is a prerequisite. Internationally acclaimed business executive and entrepreneur Ad Nederlof is the classic example of “newspaper boy to captain of industry”. With little or no formal schooling to boast, he now holds a career of well over 50 years in the IT-industry – and the end is by no means in sight. Started off as a sales representative he worked his way up to executive positions until he could grow no further. Curious to put his vision of delivering excellent customer service to the test – and his own money where his mouth was – in 2005, at the age of 57, he started VANAD (‘owned by Ad’). Spurred by his enthusiasm, VANAD has grown from 20 to 2,000 employees since then. Throughout the years Ad added several rapidly growing companies to the portfolio. One of them, Enovation, he sold in 2018 for over € 100 million. Money he is now putting to work through Addington.
