## Packages
framer-motion | Required for smooth page transitions and component animations

Integration with Framer components requires importing './framer/styles.css' in App.tsx.
The app uses a mix of static Framer layout components and dynamic React forms.
Images will use Unsplash placeholders where dynamic images aren't available.
