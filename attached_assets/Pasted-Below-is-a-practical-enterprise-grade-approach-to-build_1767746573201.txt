Below is a **practical, enterprise-grade approach** to building a web crawler engine to **discover and download public reports** from **McKinsey, BCG, Bain, KPMG, and PitchBook**, with clear separation between what is **technically feasible** and what is **legally permissible**.

---

## 1. Critical Legal & Access Reality (Read First)

### Public Consulting Firms (McKinsey, BCG, Bain, KPMG)

* **Allowed**: Crawling and downloading **publicly accessible reports, insights, PDFs, and articles**
* **Constraints**:

  * Must respect `robots.txt`
  * Rate-limit requests
  * No authentication bypass
  * No scraping gated content or newsletters behind forms

### PitchBook

* **NOT crawlable legally**
* PitchBook is a **paid, authenticated SaaS**
* Scraping violates:

  * Terms of Service
  * CFA/IP protections
* **Correct approach**:

  * Use **PitchBook API** (paid)
  * Or manual export
  * Or exclude entirely from crawler

**Conclusion**
Your crawler should:

* **Include**: McKinsey, BCG, Bain, KPMG
* **Exclude**: PitchBook (unless via API)

## 2. Recommended System Architecture

```
Crawler Engine
├── Seed URL Manager
├── Robots.txt Validator
├── Page Fetcher (Requests / Playwright)
├── Content Classifier
│   ├── PDF Detection
│   ├── Report Keyword Filter
├── Downloader
├── Metadata Extractor
├── Storage Layer
│   ├── Raw PDFs
│   ├── Metadata (JSON / DB)
└── Scheduler & Rate Limiter
```

---

## 3. Target Domains & Seed URLs

```text
McKinsey: https://www.mckinsey.com/insights
BCG:      https://www.bcg.com/publications
Bain:     https://www.bain.com/insights/
KPMG:     https://kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights.html
```

---

## 4. Tech Stack (Recommended)

### Core

* **Python 3.10+**
* `Scrapy` → scalable crawling
* `Playwright` → JS-heavy pages
* `BeautifulSoup4` → parsing
* `pdfminer.six` or `pypdf` → PDF text extraction

### Storage

* PDFs → S3 / local object store
* Metadata → PostgreSQL or SQLite
* Optional: ElasticSearch for full-text search

---

## 5. Scrapy Spider Example (Consulting Reports)

```python
import scrapy
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class ConsultingReportsSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "consulting_reports"

    start_urls = [
        "https://www.mckinsey.com/insights",
        "https://www.bcg.com/publications",
        "https://www.bain.com/insights/",
        "https://kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights.html",
    ]

    custom_settings = {
        "DOWNLOAD_DELAY": 2,
        "ROBOTSTXT_OBEY": True,
    }

    def parse(self, response):
        for link in response.css("a::attr(href)").getall():
            absolute = urljoin(response.url, link)

            if absolute.endswith(".pdf"):
                yield {
                    "file_urls": [absolute],
                    "source": response.url,
                }

            elif any(keyword in absolute.lower() for keyword in ["report", "insight", "publication"]):
                yield scrapy.Request(absolute, callback=self.parse)
```

---

## 6. PDF Download Pipeline

```python
ITEM_PIPELINES = {
    "scrapy.pipelines.files.FilesPipeline": 1,
}

FILES_STORE = "./reports"
```

Each PDF stored with:

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "firm": "McKinsey",
  "year": 2024,
  "url": "...",
  "file_path": "...",
  "crawl_date": "..."
}
```

---

## 7. Report Classification (Optional but Powerful)

Use NLP to filter **real reports** vs blog posts:

### Keyword Scoring

```python
REPORT_TERMS = [
    "global report",
    "industry outlook",
    "survey",
    "benchmark",
    "white paper"
]
```

### ML Enhancement

* TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
* Classify: `Report` vs `Article`

---

## 8. PitchBook — Correct Integration Strategy

**Do NOT crawl**

Instead:

* PitchBook API (Enterprise)
* Manual exports
* Third-party licensed datasets

If you want **PitchBook-like data**, alternatives:

* Crunchbase API
* Dealroom
* CB Insights (API)

---

## 9. Production Hardening

| Concern      | Solution                |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| IP blocking  | Rotating proxies        |
| JS rendering | Playwright              |
| Site changes | Domain-specific spiders |
| Scale        | Scrapy Cluster          |
| Compliance   | Audit logs              |

## 10. Deliverables You Can Build Next

If you want, I can:

1. Build a **full Scrapy project repo**
2. Add **Playwright fallback**
3. Create a **Postgres schema**
4. Add **search UI (FastAPI + React)**
5. Integrate **LLM summarization of reports**
6. Create a **weekly auto-crawler with Airflow**

If you want this aligned with your **investor research / family office / AI diligence workflows**, say so and I will design it accordingly.
