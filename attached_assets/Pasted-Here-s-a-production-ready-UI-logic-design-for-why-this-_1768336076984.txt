# **1️⃣ Film Investor Match UI Logic — “Why This Match”**

### **Overview**

The goal: **show founders/investors why a particular match is recommended**, using your multi-factor algorithm, semantic embeddings, and deal structure multipliers.

---

### **UI Components**

#### **A. Match Card / Summary**

* **Header:** Investor Name / Company
* **Score:** 0–100% (colored gradient: red → green)
* **Tagline:** One-liner reason: e.g.,
  *“Strong alignment on slate financing, revenue participation, and horror genre films.”*

#### **B. Factor Breakdown (Expandable / Tooltip)**

| Factor                        | Weight | Score | Explanation                                                                                                         |

* **Visualization:**
  Use **progress bars**, **sparklines**, or **radar charts**.
  Tooltips explain **why the score is high/low** for each factor.

---

#### **C. Semantic Explanation (Optional Layer)**

> Text generated from embeddings to make the score human-readable.

```
"This investor specializes in financing multi-picture slates in the horror and thriller genres, typically using revenue participation or preferred equity. Your project aligns with their risk and stage profile."
```

---

#### **D. Deal Alerts / Flags**

* Highlight mismatches or risk areas:

  * “Check size slightly below preferred minimum” → ⚠️
  * “Genre preference mismatch (Comedy vs Horror)” → ⚠️
* Show “conditional compatibility”: “70% chance of interest if structure is adjusted to preferred equity.”

---

#### **E. Interaction Layer**

* Buttons:

  * “Request Intro” → triggers backend matchmaking logic
  * “Adjust Deal Structure” → updates predicted compatibility dynamically
  * “Save / Favorite”

* Hover / Click Actions:

  * Display **why score dropped** or **why factor is penalized**
  * Tooltips use taxonomy labels (e.g., “Gap Financing mismatch”)

### **Key Implementation Notes**

1. **Semantic Layer**: Use **embeddings for project description vs investor thesis** (Film or Real Estate).
2. **Multiplier Layer**: Display hard penalties / bonuses (check size, geography, stage).
3. **Visualization**: Use **radar charts, progress bars, or gradient bars** for clarity.
4. **Conditional UI**: Allow founders to tweak deal terms and immediately see **updated compatibility**.
5. **Actionable Insights**: Always explain mismatches; helps founders adjust projects or filter investors early.
