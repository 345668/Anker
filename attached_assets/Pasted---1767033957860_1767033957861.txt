𝐀 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 𝐨𝐟 𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐞-𝐅𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐲 𝐎𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐆𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐲, 𝐒𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐳𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐝 & 𝐀𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐚 (𝐃𝐀𝐂𝐇 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧) 👇

Germany, Austria & Switzerland quietly control some of the most influential private capital in the world.

Yet most people outside Europe barely understand how this region operates.

Quick context for those outside of Europe:

𝐃𝐀𝐂𝐇 refers to 𝐆𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐲 (𝐃), 𝐀𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐚 (𝐀), and 𝐒𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐳𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐝 (𝐂𝐇) — three countries with:

▪️Deep industrial, real estate, and entrepreneurial capital
▪️A strong preference for discretion over visibility
▪️One of the highest concentrations of privately held wealth

Unlike the US or UK, capital here is rarely loud.

Many families don’t advertise.
They don’t “raise funds.”
They don’t chase deals.

They operate through holdings, private investment vehicles, foundations, and family offices that often look invisible from the outside.

To make this more concrete, I’m sharing a curated list of family offices across the DACH region below.👇
