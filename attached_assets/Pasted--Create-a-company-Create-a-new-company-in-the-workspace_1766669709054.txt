# Create a company

> Create a new company in the workspace.

Create a company in the workspace, optionally adding them to one or more groups. In the app, companies without groups will only be visible through the "Search" section.

  Company names are unique across the workspace. If you try to create a company
  with a name that already exists, the existing company will be returned.

                    The custom field values associated with the company, grouped

                    }

                    ```


                    The group ids passed must also be provided in the `groups`
                    field, otherwise a validation error will be thrown.


                    The format of the custom field value depends on the type of
                    the custom field:


                    - `textField`: string, eg: `"Foo"`

                    - `numericField`: number or numeric string, eg: `42` or
                    `"42"`

                    - `dateField`: ISO 8601 string (YYYY-MM-DD), eg:
                    `"2021-01-01"`

                    - `singleSelect`: string (option label), eg: `"Active"`

                    - `multipleSelect`: array of strings (option labels), eg:
                    `["B2B", "B2C"]`

                    - `contactField`: array of objects with `id` property, eg:
                    `[{"id": "per_20228901-ce2b-418c-a267-671823107d8c"}]`

                    - `userField`: array of objects with either `id` (workspace
                    user id) or `email` (workspace user email) property, eg:
                    `[{"id": "usr_a23373bb-5296-4c59-b2e8-8f121707d562"},
                    {"email": "jane@example.com"}]`

                    - `magicField`: string, eg: `"foo"`

                    - `objectField`: array of objects with `id` property, eg:
                    `[{"id": "obj_2f62707c-52c0-421a-a11f-68e1ce9610f4"}]`


                    Passing a `null` value or an empty array will unset the
                    custom field value.
