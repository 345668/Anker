looks like the problem  is the site web socket:
[vite] failed to connect to websocket. your current setup: (browser) 5d0688d7-2d8b-4df4-9468-1224acf0c2f6-00-3hsanc4rt7ie0.janeway.replit.dev/ <--[HTTP]--> localhost:5173/ (server) (browser) 5d0688d7-2d8b-4df4-9468-1224acf0c2f6-00-3hsanc4rt7ie0.janeway.replit.dev:/vite-hmr <--[WebSocket (failing)]--> localhost:5173/ (server) 
You are correct: this is a Vite HMR WebSocket misconfiguration, not a PDF.js issue.
What you are seeing is a proxy / tunnel mismatch between the public Replit URL and Vite’s local dev server.

What the Error Means (Plain English)
Vite is running on:
localhost:5173
But your browser is accessing the app through:
https://5d0688d7-2d8b-4df4-9468-1224acf0c2f6-00-3hsanc4rt7ie0.janeway.replit.dev
Vite tries to open its HMR WebSocket at:
ws://localhost:5173/vite-hmr
From the browser’s point of view:
localhost:5173 does not exist
The WebSocket is therefore rejected
Vite logs a WebSocket failure
This does not break your app, but:
HMR will not work
Console fills with WebSocket errors
Framer / Vite dev tooling behaves erratically
The Correct Fix (You Must Edit ONE File)
Edit: vite.config.ts
Add explicit HMR host + protocol settings.
✅ Recommended Replit-safe config
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    host: true,
    port: 5173,
    hmr: {
      protocol: 'wss',
      host: '5d0688d7-2d8b-4df4-9468-1224acf0c2f6-00-3hsanc4rt7ie0.janeway.replit.dev',
      port: 443
    }
  }
});
📌 Replace the host value exactly with your Replit domain.
Why This Works
Problem	Fix
Browser can’t reach localhost	Use public domain
HTTP → WSS mismatch	Force wss
Vite defaults break in tunnels	Override HMR
Optional (If You Don’t Care About HMR)
If this is a demo or static preview, you can disable HMR entirely:
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    hmr: false
  }
});
This will:
Remove all WebSocket errors
Disable hot reload
Leave the app otherwise functional
Important Clarification
This WebSocket issue is unrelated to:
PDF worker 404
Video 403 errors
Importing a module script failed
Those are separate issues (already identified as PDF worker + asset permissions).
