Below are **authoritative resources and third‑party data options** you can use for (a) crawling publicly available reports from major consulting and accounting firm sites and (b) *PitchBook‑like** data if PitchBook itself isn’t accessible.

## A. Resources for Crawling Public Reports from Firms

### 1) **Understanding and Respecting robots.txt**

Before you crawl any site, check its **robots.txt** to see what the site allows bots to fetch. Tools and guides you should read:

* **Google’s robots.txt guide** — explains what the file does and how crawlers should respect it. ([Google for Developers][1])
* **SEO/technical guides** — practical best practices for reading and interpreting robots.txt (including how to avoid being blocked). ([Search Engine Journal][2])

Use a simple request to retrieve a site’s robots.txt before crawling:

```
GET https://www.example.com/robots.txt
```

then parse directives like `Disallow` and `Allow` when scheduling requests.

### 2) **Consulting & Accounting Firm Content Areas to Crawl**

Here are the typical *public* report hubs for the firms you mentioned:

| Firm                   | Public Research/Insights URL (crawlable)                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **McKinsey & Company** | [https://www.mckinsey.com/insights](https://www.mckinsey.com/insights)                                   |
| **Deloitte Insights**  | [https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/insights.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/insights.html)   |
| **PwC Insights**       | [https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/insights.html](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/insights.html) |
| **KPMG Insights**      | [https://kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights.html](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights.html)                   |
| **EY (Ernst & Young)** | [https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights)                                   |

These sections contain press releases, PDF reports, white papers, and research.
To target report documents (often PDF or HTML pages), you can filter for:

* URL patterns containing `/insights/`, `/reports/`, `/publications/`
* File types `.pdf`, `.pptx`, etc.

Always verify allowed URLs in the robots.txt first.

### 3) **Tools & Libraries for Crawling**

Depending on the complexity of the site:

* **Scrapy (Python)** — framework for large‑scale distributed crawlers.
* **Playwright or Selenium** — for rendering JavaScript‑generated pages before scraping.
* **BeautifulSoup / lxml** — to parse HTML and extract links or metadata.

When crawling, integrate:

* **robots.txt parsing** (e.g., using `robotparser` in Python)
* **rate limiting and throttling**
* **user agent tagging** (identify your bot clearly)

These practices help ensure compliance and avoid being blocked.

## B. Third‑Party Data Sources (PitchBook Alternatives)

If your goal is *PitchBook‑style datasets* (companies, deals, funding, investors), here are **data platforms—some with free or lower‑cost access options**:

### 1) **Crunchbase**

* Well‑known startup and funding database with a **freemium tier** and API access for production workflows.
* Good for early‑stage company, investor, funding round, and basic deal data. ([Exploding Topics][3])

**Use cases:** startup profiles, investor lists, funding rounds.

---

### 2) **Dealroom**

* European‑focused venture and scaleup data with APIs and CSV export.
* Strong ecosystem mapping features and funding data. ([Exploding Topics][3])

**Use cases:** European startup market intelligence, funding metadata.

---

### 3) **OpenVC**

* Free and open investor database (lighter coverage).
* Good choice for early‑stage data and simple integrations. ([fundediq.co][4])

**Use cases:** open funding signals, investor lists.

---

### 4) **Preqin**

* Institutional‑grade alternative asset intelligence, directly comparable to PitchBook coverage for funds, PE, venture, and alternatives. ([Wikipedia][5])

**Use cases:** deep private capital market data (subscription).

---

### 5) **Vendor Marketplaces (e.g., Brightdata)**

Platforms like Bright Data sell **pitchbook‑tagged datasets** (company and deal records) in purchasable chunks (CSV/JSON). This is *not the PitchBook API* but third‑party repackaged slices of data you can use. ([Bright Data][6])

**Use cases:** downloaded datasets for analytics workflows.

---

### 6) **Sector and Deals Alternatives**

Depending on focus, you might also consider:

* **CB Insights** – industry and funding insights (enterprise pricing). ([Veridion][7])
* **S&P Capital IQ Pro** – deep financial and M&A data with API access. ([G2][8])
* **Tracxn** – AI‑driven startup signals. ([Exploding Topics][3])
* **DealPotential** – emerging private market intelligence alternative with flexible plans. ([DealPotential][9])

These are *not free* but often offer flexible contracts or demos.

---

## C. Practical Notes

### Access Patterns

* Most enterprise platforms require contracts or paid subscriptions.
* Some (Crunchbase, OpenVC) offer **limited free or low‑cost API access** — suitable for prototyping or small data sets.

### Ethical Crawling Practice

* Always obey **robots.txt** when scraping firm websites.
* Respect terms of service — especially for professional data platforms. Scraping private or authenticated content is prohibited.

If you want, I can provide **sample Scrapy spiders** tailored to these firm sites (e.g., McKinsey, Deloitte, PwC, KPMG) that take robots.txt into account and specifically extract **report links and metadata**. Just let me know your preferred programming language and scope.
