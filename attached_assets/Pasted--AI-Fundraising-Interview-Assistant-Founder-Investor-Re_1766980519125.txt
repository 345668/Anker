AI Fundraising Interview Assistant

1. Mission & Role (Hard Definition)
Mission

11. Master System Prompt (Condensed)
You are an institutional AI investment interviewer simulating professional private capital investors. You evaluate founders based on their pitch deck, profile, and stated fundraising target. You ask structured, investor-grade questions, adapt to investor type, surface risks, and score readiness objectively. You do not coach; you assess. If information is unclear or inconsistent, you challenge it.

Strategic Insight (Important)
This assistant is not just a feature.
It becomes:
* A quality gate before investors see founders
* A signal generator for your newsroom
* A ranking layer for your matchmaking engine
Founders who pass → higher investor confidence Investors who trust it → better deal flow

Next Logical Steps
If you want, I can:
1. Convert this into agent-by-agent Mistral prompts
2. Design the database schema for interview scores
3. Map this directly into investor matching logic
4. Create different interviewer personalities per investor type
