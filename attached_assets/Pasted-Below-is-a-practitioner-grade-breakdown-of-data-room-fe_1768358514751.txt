Below is a **practitioner-grade breakdown** of **data room features, requirements, and access control**, tailored specifically to **investors and founders** in a private-markets context (VC, PE, Private Credit, Real Estate). This aligns with the trust, confidentiality, and vetting posture you have established with Upper Echelon.

---

# 1. Purpose of a Modern Investor Data Room

A data room is **not a file repository**. It is a **controlled disclosure system** that:

* Progressively reveals information
* Enforces confidentiality
* Creates an audit trail
* Supports diligence, not discovery

---

# 2. Core User Roles

### Founders / Deal Sponsors

* Upload and manage deal materials
* Control disclosure stages
* Respond to diligence requests

### Investors

* Review materials
* Ask questions
* Track diligence progress

### Admin / Platform Operator

* Approves access
* Enforces compliance
* Monitors activity

---

# 3. Functional Feature Set (Required)

## 3.1 Document Management (Foundational)

**Requirements**

* Folder hierarchy by diligence category
* Version control
* File type validation
* Watermarking (dynamic per user)

**Typical Categories**

* Overview & Pitch
* Financials
* Legal
* Cap Table / Ownership
* Market & Strategy
* Technical / IP
* ESG / Compliance (where applicable)

---

## 3.2 Progressive Disclosure (Critical)

Data must **not** be fully visible on day one.

**Disclosure Levels**

1. Teaser / Executive Summary
2. Confidential Information Memorandum (CIM)
3. Detailed Financials & Legal
4. Final / Confirmatory Diligence

**System Requirements**

* Disclosure level per document
* Investor access tied to diligence stage
* Manual or rule-based promotion

---

## 3.3 Access Control & Permissions (Non-Negotiable)

### Access Is **Explicit**, Not Implied

**Permission Dimensions**

* User role (investor / founder / admin)
* Membership tier (e.g. Inner Circle)
* Deal-specific approval
* Jurisdiction eligibility

**Capabilities**

* View only
* Download (rare, controlled)
* Comment / Q&A
* Upload (founders only)

---

## 3.4 NDA & Legal Controls

**Requirements**

* NDA acceptance prior to access
* NDA versioning
* Timestamped consent
* Revocation enforcement

**Advanced Controls**

* NDA tied to deal, not user globally
* Jurisdiction-specific NDA variants

---

## 3.5 Audit & Monitoring (Trust Layer)

**Tracked Events**

* File views
* Time spent per document
* Downloads
* Q&A interactions
* Access revocations

**Why This Matters**

* Founder confidence
* Investor seriousness signaling
* Legal defensibility

---

## 3.6 Q&A / Diligence Communication

**Requirements**

* Structured Q&A threads
* Private or shared questions
* Founder responses logged
* Ability to publish answers to all approved investors

---

## 3.7 Security & Anti-Leak Measures

**Baseline**

* View-only PDF rendering
* Disable right-click
* Disable copy/paste where possible

**Advanced**

* Per-user watermark
* Screenshot deterrence
* Session-based access expiry

(No system is leak-proof, but deterrence + logging is essential.)

---

# 4. Access Handling — Step by Step

## 4.1 Founder Flow

1. Upload documents
2. Assign disclosure level
3. Submit data room for review
4. Approve or deny investor requests
5. Promote investors through diligence stages

---

## 4.2 Investor Flow

1. Request access to deal
2. Accept NDA
3. Receive staged access
4. Review documents
5. Ask questions
6. Gain deeper access over time

---

## 4.3 Admin / Platform Flow

1. Approve deal for platform
2. Verify investor eligibility
3. Monitor activity
4. Intervene if misuse occurs
5. Revoke access if needed

---

# 5. Technical Requirements (Implementation-Level)

## 5.1 Data Model (Simplified)

```text
User
- role
- membership_tier
- jurisdiction
- verification_status

Deal
- asset_class
- status
- sponsor_id

DataRoom
- deal_id
- disclosure_policy

Document
- data_room_id
- disclosure_level
- version
- checksum

AccessGrant
- user_id
- deal_id
- permission_set
- granted_at
- revoked_at
```

---

## 5.2 Security Requirements

* Encrypted storage at rest
* TLS in transit
* Signed URLs with expiry
* Server-side permission checks (never client-only)
* Immutable audit logs

---

# 6. Compliance & Trust Considerations

* Do **not** position the data room as “investment advice”
* Log all disclosures
* Respect jurisdictional restrictions
* Allow founders to redact or retract documents

---

# 7. What Differentiates a Premium Platform (Optional but Powerful)

* AI-assisted document summaries
* Red-flag detection (missing docs, anomalies)
* Investor engagement analytics
* Founder readiness scoring

---

# 8. Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Flat folder access for all investors
* No NDA enforcement
* No audit trail
* No access revocation mechanism
* Treating founders and investors symmetrically

---

## Final Assessment

A proper investor data room is:

* **Progressive**
* **Permissioned**
* **Auditable**
* **Revocable**

If any of those four are missing, the system does not meet institutional standards.

---

If you want next, I can:

* Design a **data room permission matrix**
* Provide a **document taxonomy per asset class**
* Map this into **GitHub issues & schemas**
* Draft **UX flows for founders vs investors**

Tell me which artifact you want next.
