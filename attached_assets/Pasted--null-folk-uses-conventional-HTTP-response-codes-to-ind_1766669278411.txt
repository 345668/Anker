folk uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.
In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.).
Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with folk's servers.

## Error response

The error response contains a single `error` object that includes the following properties:

* `code`: The code that identifies the error.
* `message`: A human-readable description of the error.
* `documentationUrl`: An URL to the documentation that describes the error.
* `timestamp`: The timestamp when the error occurred.
* `requestId`: [The request identifier](/api-reference/request-id).

```json  theme={null}
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "The requested resource was not found.",
    "documentationUrl": "https://developer.folk.app/api-reference/errors#not-found",
    "requestId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Some `4xx` errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., validation errors) include a `details` property that provides more information about the error.
Refer to each specific error in order to see if a `details` property is available and its shape.

```json {8-12} theme={null}
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "The rate limit has been exceeded.",
    "documentationUrl": "https://developer.folk.app/api-reference/errors#rate-limiting",
    "requestId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-01T12:00:00Z",
    "details": {
      "limit": 1000,
      "remaining": 0,
      "retryAfter": "2025-10-01T12:00:00Z"
