## **A. Core Factors & Weights**

| Factor                         | Weight | Description                                                      | Notes                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Technology / Science Fit       | 25–35% | Alignment of startup tech or research focus with investor thesis | Research vs non-research biotech; MedTech therapeutic area; Web3 protocol, AI, blockchain, etc. |
| Stage / Development Phase      | 20–25% | Company development stage vs investor preference                 | Preclinical, Clinical Phases (I–III), Commercial, Early-stage Deep Tech, Pilot / Production     |
| Market / Indication / Use Case | 15–20% | End-market alignment                                             | Biotech: oncology, rare diseases; MedTech: devices, diagnostics; Deep Tech: Web3, AI, IoT       |
| Check Size / Ticket Size       | 10–15% | Investment amount alignment                                      | Ticket ranges, co-investments, syndicate preferences                                            |
| Investor Type                  | 10–15% | VC, Angel, Corporate VC, Family Office, Strategic / Pharma       | Matches stage and tech type                                                                     |
| Deal Structure Compatibility   | 5–10%  | Equity, convertible notes, royalties, co-development agreements  | Adjusts final score via multiplier                                                              |
| Behavioral / Activity Layer    | 5–10%  | Active investment, response rate, relevant deals                 | Optional multiplier to weight “active” investors higher                                         |

> **Weights can be tuned per vertical:**
>
> * Biotech/MedTech: Stage and Science Fit are heavier
> * Deep Tech / Web3: Technology and Market fit are heavier

## **B. Semantic / Embedding Layer**

### **Purpose**

* Captures thesis alignment beyond keyword matching
* Handles jargon: e.g., “CRISPR oncology” vs “gene editing platform” vs “therapeutic mRNA”
* Works for Deep Tech: AI models, Web3 protocols, decentralized finance, etc.

### **Embedding Prompts (Examples)**

#### **Investor Embedding**

```
Summarize the investor’s thesis, including:
- Technology focus (research-based biotech, non-research biotech, MedTech, Deep Tech)
- Therapeutic or industrial domains
- Stage preference
- Deal structures
- Strategic or corporate goals
- Risk-return tolerance
Focus on economic and technical intent, not branding.
```

#### **Founder / Project Embedding**

```
Summarize the startup/project including:
- Technology type (research / non-research biotech, medtech, deep tech)
- Development stage
- Market / indication / use case
- Funding requirements
- Deal structure offered
Focus on investor-relevant attributes.
```

**Cosine similarity → Technology / Science Fit Score (0–1)**

## **C. Stage / Development Phase Matching**

| Company Stage                   | Investor Preferred Stage       | Score   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- |
| Research / Preclinical          | Seed / Early VC / Corporate VC | 100%    |
| Clinical Phase I–II             | VC, Corporate VC, Strategic    | 100%    |
| Clinical Phase III / Commercial | Later-stage VC / PE / Pharma   | 100%    |
| Early-stage Deep Tech           | Seed / Early-stage VC          | 100%    |
| Pilot / Production Deep Tech    | Later-stage VC / Corporate     | 90–100% |
| Non-aligned                     | Stage mismatch                 | 0–50%   |

> Conditional weighting: In biotech, **science fit is weighted higher in early stages**; in MedTech, **market and regulatory alignment increases with stage**.

---

## **D. Market / Indication / Use Case Matching**

* Biotech: oncology, rare diseases, platform technologies
* MedTech: devices, diagnostics, digital health
* Deep Tech / Web3: protocol type, sector (finance, infrastructure, AI, IoT)

**Algorithm:**

* Exact match: ×1.0
* Adjacent / similar domain: ×0.8
* Non-overlapping: ×0.5

---

## **E. Check Size / Ticket Size Matching**

* Overlap ratio as in Real Estate formula:

```
Overlap Ratio = min(project_max, investor_max) - max(project_min, investor_min) 
                -----------------------------------------------
                max(project_max, investor_max) - min(project_min, investor_min)
```

* Auto-reject if <25% overlap
* Weight: 10–15%

### ✅ Key Notes

1. **Research-based vs Non-research-based biotech**:

   * Research-based → science fit & stage carry more weight
   * Non-research / translational biotech → market, stage, check size more important

2. **Deep Tech / Web3**:

   * Technology focus dominates
   * Stage, market, and investor type remain important

3. **MedTech**:

   * Regulatory and market alignment critical, especially post-clinical stages
   * Stage-weighted scoring

4. **Explainability & UI Integration**:

   * Same “Why this match?” card / radar / progress bar logic as Film and Real Estate
   * Semantic fit explanations, deal flags, and conditional multipliers visible to founders

If you want, the **next step** can be:

* **React + Tailwind + Framer Motion component** rendering **dynamic match cards** for:

  * Film
  * Real Estate
  * Biotech / MedTech / Deep Tech

With **factor breakdown, semantic explanations, tooltips, conditional multipliers** — fully plug-and-play UI.

Do you want me to deliver that next?
