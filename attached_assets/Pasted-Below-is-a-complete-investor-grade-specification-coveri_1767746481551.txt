Below is a **complete, investor-grade specification** covering all five items you requested. This is written at the level you would hand to an engineer, a compliance officer, or an investment team without further interpretation.

---

# 1. Exact URL Allow / Deny Rules (Hard Enforcement)

This must be implemented as **code-level policy**, not documentation.

## 1.1 Global Crawl Rules (All Sources)

### Always Enforce

* Respect `robots.txt`
* Abort on:

  * `401 / 403`
  * Redirects to `/login`, `/subscribe`, `/trial`
* Max depth per domain: **3**
* User-Agent explicitly identified (research bot)

---

## 1.2 PitchBook – Strict Whitelist Model

### ✅ ALLOW (HTML only)

```
^https://pitchbook\.com/news(/.*)?$
```

Examples:

* [https://pitchbook.com/news](https://pitchbook.com/news)
* [https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/)*
* [https://pitchbook.com/news/industry-tech/](https://pitchbook.com/news/industry-tech/)*

### ❌ DENY (Explicit Blocklist)

```
/research
/library
/venture-monitor
/benchmarks
/indexes
/dashboards
/tools
/premium
/login
/subscribe
/trial
/api
/download
.pdf
```

### Enforcement Rules

* **Do not follow internal links** outside `/news`
* **Do not download PDFs**
* **Do not scrape tables**
* **Do not extract numeric datasets**

PitchBook is treated as **editorial commentary only**.

---

## 1.3 Consulting & Big 4 (Standard Allow)

### Allowed

* `/insights`
* `/publications`
* `/reports`
* `/perspectives`
* `.pdf` files that are public

### Denied

* Gated content
* Email capture walls
* Partner-only portals

---

# 2. Source-Weighting Logic (Investor-Grade Trust Model)

This directly affects **IC outputs**.

## 2.1 Source Trust Tiers

| Tier   | Source Type                        | Weight |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
| Tier 1 | McKinsey, BCG, Bain                | 0.95   |
| Tier 2 | Big 4 (KPMG, PwC, Deloitte, EY)    | 0.85   |
| Tier 3 | Regulators (SEC, OECD, World Bank) | 0.90   |
| Tier 4 | PitchBook Insights (News only)     | 0.65   |
| Tier 5 | Media / Blogs                      | 0.40   |

---

## 2.2 Metric Confidence Formula

```text
final_confidence =
  source_weight
× corroboration_factor
× recency_factor
```

### Corroboration

* Appears in ≥2 Tier-1/2 sources → `1.0`
* Single source → `0.7`

### Recency

* <12 months → `1.0`
* 12–36 months → `0.8`
* > 36 months → `0.6`

---

## 2.3 Rule for PitchBook

* PitchBook **cannot**:

  * Set numeric truth
  * Override Tier-1 contradictions
* PitchBook **can**:

  * Confirm trend direction
  * Flag momentum changes
  * Provide market sentiment color

---

# 3. PitchBook-Specific NLP Prompts (Safe & Targeted)

PitchBook prompts must **explicitly avoid numeric extraction**.

## 3.1 Allowed Prompt Template

**Purpose:** Market sentiment & narrative only.

```
You are analyzing an editorial article from PitchBook Insights.

Task:
1. Identify the main market trend discussed
2. Extract qualitative signals (e.g. slowdown, acceleration, risk appetite)
3. Note any directional statements WITHOUT treating numbers as factual
4. Flag statements that are opinion vs observation

Output:
- Trend summary (max 5 bullets)
- Sentiment: Positive / Neutral / Negative
- Time horizon mentioned
- Caution notes (if any)
```

---

## 3.2 Explicitly Forbidden Prompt Behaviors

The model must **never**:

* Treat deal counts as ground truth
* Extract benchmark values
* Infer valuations
* Compare PitchBook numbers to consulting numbers

This is enforced via system prompt + post-processing rules.

---

# 4. Compliance Checklist (Family Office / Institutional Use)

This is what protects you legally and reputationally.

## 4.1 Data Ingestion Checklist

* [ ] robots.txt respected
* [ ] No authentication bypass
* [ ] No licensed dashboards scraped
* [ ] Source classified correctly
* [ ] Editorial vs research tagged
* [ ] Audit log stored

---

## 4.2 Data Usage Checklist

* [ ] PitchBook tagged as “Editorial / Commentary”
* [ ] No PitchBook data used as sole numeric justification
* [ ] All metrics cited with primary sources
* [ ] Conflicts flagged automatically

---

## 4.3 Distribution Checklist

* [ ] Internal use only unless licensed
* [ ] LP-facing material excludes restricted data
* [ ] Citations included in IC memos
* [ ] Access controls enforced

---

# 5. Mapping Into an IC Memo Workflow

This is where everything comes together.

---

## 5.1 IC Memo Structure (Standard)

```
1. Executive Summary
2. Market Overview
3. Sector Dynamics
4. Capital & Competitive Landscape
5. Risks & Counterarguments
6. Investment Thesis
7. Appendix & Sources
```

---

## 5.2 How Each Source Feeds the Memo

### Market Overview

* McKinsey / BCG → market size, structure
* Big 4 → regulation, operations

### Sector Dynamics

* Consulting reports → drivers
* PitchBook → sentiment, momentum

### Capital Landscape

* Crunchbase / Dealroom → rounds, players
* PitchBook → narrative only (e.g. “late-stage cooling”)

### Risks

* Consulting contradictions
* Regulatory notes
* PitchBook cautionary commentary

---

## 5.3 Automated IC Output Example

```text
PitchBook Insights indicates a deceleration in late-stage VC activity,
which aligns with Bain’s observation of extended exit timelines.
However, McKinsey data shows sustained demand growth at the application layer.
```

Notice:

* PitchBook never stands alone
* It supports, not leads

---

# Final Assessment

What you now have is:

* A **legally clean ingestion layer**
* An **institutionally credible weighting model**
* A **defensible AI usage framework**
* A **direct mapping to IC decision-making**

This is **exactly** how professional investment platforms are structured.

---

## If you want next (recommended):

* Database schema for all of this
* YAML policy config for crawler enforcement
* Example IC memo generated end-to-end
* UI wireframe for analyst usage

Say which one you want to execute next.
