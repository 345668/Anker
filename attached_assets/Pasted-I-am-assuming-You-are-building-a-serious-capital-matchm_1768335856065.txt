I am assuming:

You are building a serious capital matchmaking platform, not a content marketplace

Precision > recall

Film is treated as a financial asset class, not a creative category

3. Embedding Prompt Templates

(Semantic Matching Engine)

These prompts are used to generate vector embeddings.

Investor Embedding Prompt
You are a professional film investor.

Summarize the investor’s capital deployment strategy, including:
- Type of film/media investments
- Preferred deal structures
- Risk tolerance
- Target returns
- Typical role in deals
- Genres and markets of interest

Focus on economic intent, not branding language.

Founder / Project Embedding Prompt
You are evaluating a film investment opportunity.

Summarize the project’s:
- Financing structure and capital need
- Risk profile and downside protection
- Revenue drivers and distribution strategy
- Genre and target market
- Team capability and track record

Focus on investor-relevant economics, not creative description.

Usage

Cosine similarity = Semantic Fit Score

This replaces most of your current “Industry” logic

4. Deal-Structure Compatibility Matrix

(Auto-Reject Logic)

This prevents invalid matches before scoring.

Founder Offering ↓ / Investor Preference →	Debt	Rev Share	Equity	Preferred
Senior Debt Only	✅	❌	❌	❌
Revenue Participation	⚠️	✅	⚠️	⚠️
Preferred Equity	❌	⚠️	⚠️	✅
Common Equity Only	❌	❌	✅	⚠️

Rules

❌ = auto-reject

⚠️ = penalty multiplier (0.6–0.8)

✅ = full compatibility

5. Film-Specific Scoring Multipliers

(Layered on Your Existing Algorithm)

These are non-linear adjustments.

A. Capital Intent Multiplier

Exact match: ×1.25

Adjacent match: ×0.85

Mismatch: ×0.40

B. Risk Profile Alignment

Aligned: ×1.15

Neutral: ×1.00

Misaligned: ×0.70

C. Structure Compatibility

Fully compatible: ×1.20

Partial: ×0.80

Invalid: reject

D. Genre Efficiency (optional but powerful)

Horror / thriller (low budget): ×1.10

Prestige drama (no presales): ×0.90

Documentary + grants attached: ×1.05

E. Activity & Realism

Investor active last 90 days: ×1.10

No film deals in 24 months: ×0.75

Final Composite Score
Final Score =
  Base Algorithm Score
× Semantic Fit
× Capital Intent Multiplier

× Activity Multiplier

Strategic Result

With this system:

Film investors stop seeing irrelevant deals

Founders see financially credible matches

Your platform becomes defensible and trusted

Film becomes a serious asset class, not a tag
