COOL STORIES ARE BUILT HERE
A VC fund is very similar to a TV series. Each investment is a new episode in which founders are actors and investment managers are the casting directors. If the series is successful then there will be a season two.

Alex and Ruslan are sceptical about horror and drama in the investment portfolio, but always looking for a next blockbuster. Reach out to them if you are shooting one.

SEASON  01
28 EPISODES   |   CASTING ONGOING
The first investment season for Begin Capital. We are searching for blockbusters across all industries and genres to join our portfolio. We lead and participate in Seed and Series A rounds with checks from $500k up to $7M. There are no geographic borders for a real hit, but the European market is close to our heart. The season is running now and casting for new episodes is open, so let us know what you’re making. 
SEASON  02
ABOUT TO TAKE OFF...
The second season of Begin Capital will be dedicated to the world of DeepTech, Artificial Intelligence and SaaS. Our investment thesis equally values both – mind-blowing technology backend as well as proven industry applications. We'll support the most innovative and ambitious teams from the early days to help them  reach  singularity :o: With strong advisors on board and love of science fiction, the second season will soon be launched…


01.    FOCUS + MONEY
We're focused on the European market and invest at Seed and Series A stages. Our ticket size is flexible, ranging from $500k to $7M. We have no legal, structuring or ownership percentage requirements.
02.    PIRATES, WINNERS + ROBOTS
People are behind every revolution. And we are looking for exceptional founders who are Pirates, Winners and Robots.
Pirates. We are looking for founders who are not afraid to make a mistake and always ready to challenge the rules. We call them “Pirates”.
Winners. Small goals are not for us. Founders who work with us, always want to conquer the world. Nothing less. We call them “Winners”.
Robots. Building a business is hard. Founders shall have a clear understanding of all business processes and be rigorously improving every KPI. Day after day. We call them “Robots”.
03.    HYPOTHESES + NUMBERS
Unique ideas are capable of disrupting markets. But we prefer to treat all ideas as hypotheses. And we only invest in hypotheses that are tested and translatable into numbers. Numbers help us make informative and responsible investment decisions. We also believe that no unicorn was built without great attention to the numbers (except for Theranos) :o::o::o:

TO BE A PARTNER
“Partner” is not just a title for us. In good times and bad, we put the startup’s interests above our own. We' re proud to be partners with founders and  encourage close communication with our portfolio.
TO BE AN ENTREPRENEUR
We're building a new VC fund and consider ourselves entrepreneurs. We want Begin Capital to be the #1 choice for founders and are excited about the work we do every day.
TO BE AN ADVISOR
We see our mission as sharing knowledge and experience with our portfolio companies. And if our expertise is not enough, we'll find the best experts to help.
TO BE A TEAM MEMBER
We're always ready to step up and work side by side with founders. And we work hard whether it's a small task or a big challenge.
