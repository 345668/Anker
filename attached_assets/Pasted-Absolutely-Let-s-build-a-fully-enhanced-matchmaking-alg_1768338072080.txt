# **1️⃣ Vertical SaaS Investor–Founder Matchmaking Algorithm**

## **A. Core Factors & Weights**

| Factor                       | Weight | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Technology / Product Fit     | 25–30% | SaaS solution aligned with investor thesis (vertical specialization: FinTech SaaS, HealthTech SaaS, Real Estate SaaS, etc.) |
| Stage / Company Maturity     | 20–25% | Seed, Series A/B/C, Growth, Late-stage                                                                                      |
| Market / Vertical Focus      | 15–20% | Alignment of SaaS industry vertical (e.g., Retail, Manufacturing, Logistics, Healthcare)                                    |
| Check Size / Ticket Size     | 15%    | Alignment with investor typical investment range                                                                            |

| Deal Structure Compatibility | 5–10%  | Equity, convertible note, revenue participation, SaaS subscription-based revenue sharing                                    |
| Behavioral / Activity Layer  | 5–10%  | Active deals, response history, co-investment patterns                                                                      |

## **B. Semantic / Embedding Layer**

**Purpose:** capture deep vertical-specific SaaS alignment beyond keywords.

### **Investor Embedding Prompt**

```
Summarize the investor’s thesis, including:
- Vertical specialization (e.g., HealthTech, FinTech, Real Estate SaaS)
- Stage preference
- Preferred deal structures
- Target check size
- Strategic / corporate alignment
Focus on economic and product intent, not branding language.
```

### **Founder / Company Embedding Prompt**

```
Summarize the SaaS startup, including:
- Vertical domain / industry
- Stage / maturity
- Revenue model (SaaS subscription, ARR)
- Funding requirements
- Offered deal structures
Focus on investor-relevant attributes.
```

**Output:** cosine similarity → Technology/Product Fit Score (0–1)

## **C. Stage / Maturity Matching**

| Company Stage      | Investor Preferred Stage | Score  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------ |
| Seed               | Seed / Pre-seed          | 100%   |
| Series A           | Early VC / Growth        | 100%   |

## **D. Market / Vertical Alignment**

* Exact vertical match: ×1.0

Example: Retail SaaS investor → retail SaaS startup = full score, HealthTech SaaS = partial score, Logistics SaaS = moderate score if relevant synergies.

---

## **E. Check Size Matching**

Same formula as before:

```
Overlap Ratio = min(project_max, investor_max) - max(project_min, investor_min) 
                -----------------------------------------------
                max(project_max, investor_max) - min(project_min, investor_min)
```

* Auto-reject if <25%
* Weight: 15%

## **G. Deal Structure Compatibility**

* Common structures: equity, convertible note, revenue-share agreements
* SaaS-specific: ARR-based revenue participation or subscription-backed debt
* Compatibility multiplier: 0.6–1.2

---

## **H. Behavioral / Activity Layer**

* Active deal in last 12 months: ×1.1
* Past investments in same vertical: ×1.05
* Non-responsive / inactive: ×0.75

---

## **I. Final Score Formula**

```
Final Score = (
    Technology / Product Fit × 0.30 +
    Stage Compatibility × 0.25 +
    Market / Vertical Alignment × 0.15 +
    Check Size Overlap × 0.15 +
    Investor Type Compatibility × 0.10
) × Deal Structure Multiplier × Activity Multiplier
```

* Output: 0–100%
* Thresholds: ≥70% strong match, 50–69% moderate, <50% weak
