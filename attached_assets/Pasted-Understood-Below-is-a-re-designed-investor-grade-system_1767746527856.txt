Understood. Below is a **re-designed, investor-grade system** that takes your crawler foundation and **aligns it explicitly with family office research, investor intelligence, and AI-driven diligence workflows**. This is how such systems are actually built inside funds, multi-family offices, and strategy teams.

I will **not repeat** what you already defined; instead, I will **extend and operationalize it** for institutional use.

---

## 1. Strategic Objective (Investor / Family Office Lens)

Your system should answer **investment questions**, not just collect documents.

Primary goals:

* Detect **macro, sector, and thematic signals**
* Support **pre-investment screening**
* Accelerate **commercial & market diligence**
* Build a **proprietary research moat**

This reframes your crawler from *data collection* to a **research intelligence engine**.

## 3. Crawler: Investor-Grade Enhancements

### What Changes vs a “Generic Crawler”

You already have:

* Robots-aware crawling
* PDF download
* Metadata extraction

You now **add investment semantics**.

### Mandatory Metadata Fields (Expanded)

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "firm": "McKinsey",
  "publication_type": "Global Industry Report",
  "sector": ["AI", "Healthcare"],
  "subsector": ["AI Diagnostics"],
  "geography": ["Europe", "US"],
  "time_horizon": "2025–2030",
  "investment_relevance": "High",
  "confidence_score": 0.92,
  "source_weight": 0.95,
  "url": "...",
  "crawl_date": "..."
}
```

**Source weighting matters** in investment settings:

* McKinsey / BCG = higher trust
* Blogs = lower trust
* Contradictory sources flagged

---

## 4. NLP Layer: What Investors Actually Care About

### Information You Should Explicitly Extract

From each report:

* Market size figures
* Growth rates (CAGR)
* Cost drivers
* Regulatory constraints
* Adoption barriers
* Margin structure
* Buyer personas
* Value chain positioning

This is **not generic summarization**.

Example extraction targets:

```
"Global AI diagnostics market expected to grow at 18% CAGR through 2030"
→
metric: CAGR
value: 18%
sector: AI diagnostics
confidence: high
```

---

## 5. PitchBook Strategy (Investor-Aligned, Legal)

You already stated the correct rule: **do not crawl PitchBook**.

### Institutional Workaround (Standard Practice)

You build a **PitchBook-compatible abstraction layer**:

```
Company
├── Name
├── Sector
├── HQ
├── Funding Rounds
├── Investors
├── Deal Stage
├── Last Known Valuation (optional)
└── Source Attribution
```

### Data Sources to Populate It

* Crunchbase API
* Dealroom
* OpenVC
* SEC filings
* Press releases
* Your consulting reports (market validation)

This allows:

* Drop-in PitchBook data **if licensed**
* Otherwise, a legally clean replacement

Family offices do this routinely.

---

## 6. AI Diligence Workflows (This Is the Differentiator)

### Example: Pre-IC Market Diligence

Input:

* Sector: “AI in Healthcare”
* Geography: Europe
* Stage: Series A–B

System outputs:

* Top 5 consulting reports
* Market size consensus
* Growth range (min / max)
* Key risks
* Contradictory opinions (flagged)
* Investment timing signal

### Example: Deal Screening

Input:

* Company name
* Claimed TAM
* Pitch deck claims

System:

* Cross-checks claims vs consulting data
* Flags unsupported assertions
* Generates **red-flag summary**

This is **AI-assisted diligence**, not search.

---

## 7. Why This Matters for Family Offices

Family offices care about:

* **Capital preservation**
* **Thematic conviction**
* **Long-term cycles**
* **Independent research**

This system:

* Reduces dependency on sell-side
* Creates proprietary insight
* Scales across asset classes
* Improves IC decision quality

---

## 8. What I Recommend You Build Next (Order Matters)

### Phase 1 (Foundation)

* Scrapy + Playwright crawler
* PDF ingestion
* Postgres + S3
* Sector tagging

### Phase 2 (Investor Intelligence)

* NLP metric extraction
* Source confidence scoring
* ElasticSearch
* Query by sector / theme

### Phase 3 (AI Diligence)

* LLM summaries with citations
* Claim verification engine
* Deal memo generator

### Phase 4 (Institutional)

* IC-ready exports
* Audit logs
* Access control
* Multi-tenant support

---

## 9. Bottom Line

You are **not building a crawler**.

You are building a:

> **Private-market intelligence and diligence engine fed by first-party research.**

That is exactly how:

* Top family offices
* Strategy teams
* Internal PE research groups

operate today.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Design the **database schema**
* Define **LLM prompts for diligence**
* Create a **PitchBook-compatible data model**
* Map this to **fund workflows (screen → IC → monitor)**

Say which one you want first.
