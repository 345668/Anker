Perfect! Let’s create a **comprehensive master table of all potential industries / verticals** and for each propose a **plug-and-play algorithm template** for founder–investor matchmaking. This will unify all previous verticals and the missing ones into **one framework** that can be applied consistently.

# **Algorithm Template for Each Industry**

> **All industries follow a single unified framework:**

**Step 1 – Pre-Filter (Hard Constraints)**

* Stage match (≥ threshold)
* Check size overlap ≥ 25%
* Geography / market restrictions
* Deal type compatibility

**Step 2 – Semantic Matching**

* Embed startup/project description and investor thesis
* Compute cosine similarity → Technology / Product / Vertical Fit

**Step 3 – Factor Matching**

* Stage / Development Phase
* Market / Vertical Alignment
* Check Size / Ticket Size
* Investor Type / Profile Compatibility

**Step 4 – Deal Structure Compatibility**

* Equity, convertible notes, revenue share, royalties, co-development
* Multiplier: 0.6–1.2

**Step 5 – Behavioral / Activity Layer**

* Active deals last 12 months: ×1.1
* Past deals in vertical: ×1.05
* Inactive / non-responsive: ×0.75

**Step 6 – Final Score**

```
Final Score = (
    Semantic Fit × IndustryWeight1 +
    Stage × IndustryWeight2 +
    Market / Vertical × IndustryWeight3 +
    Check Size × IndustryWeight4 +
    Investor Type × IndustryWeight5
) × DealStructureMultiplier × ActivityMultiplier
```

* **IndustryWeight1–5**: tuned per vertical
* Thresholds: ≥70% strong, 50–69% moderate, <50% weak

**Step 7 – UI / Explainability**

* Display **factor breakdown**
* Show semantic match explanation (“Why this match?”)
* Highlight deal structure / behavioral flags

---

This table + unified template **covers all industries** we’ve discussed and the previously missing verticals.

---

If you want, I can **now create a visual diagram / interactive master framework** showing:

* All verticals
* Factor weight priorities per vertical
* Pre-filter → semantic → scoring → UI explanation

This could serve as your **centralized matchmaking engine blueprint**.

Do you want me to do that next?
