This is a good clarification, and the screenshot helps. The key point is that **PitchBook is partially crawlable, but only in a very narrow, well-defined way**. You can include **PitchBook Insights / News** in your system **if—and only if—you strictly constrain what you ingest**.

Below is the **investor-grade, legally clean way** to include PitchBook **without crossing into restricted territory**.

---

## 1. What From PitchBook Is Legally Crawlable

From the page you attached (`https://pitchbook.com/news`), PitchBook exposes a **public marketing + thought-leadership surface**.

### ✅ Allowed (Public, Ungated)

You may crawl:

**PitchBook → INSIGHTS → NEWS**

* Latest News
* Analysis articles
* Commentary shaping private markets
* High-level trend writeups

These pages:

* Do **not** require login
* Are **indexed by Google**
* Are **marketing/editorial content**, not database outputs

This is legally equivalent to crawling:

* McKinsey Insights
* BCG Perspectives
* Bain Briefs

### ❌ Not Allowed (Gated / Licensed)

You must **exclude entirely**:

* Research Library
* Venture Monitor PDFs
* Benchmarks
* Indexes
* Dashboards & Tools
* Any PDF requiring login
* Any page that redirects to `/login`

These are **licensed data products**, even if previews exist.

---

## 2. Correct Positioning in Your Platform

PitchBook **must not** be treated as a “data provider”.

Instead, treat it as:

> **An editorial signal source**

This is important for compliance and for how investors interpret outputs.

### Source Classification

| Source                | Role                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| McKinsey / BCG        | Primary research       |
| Big 4                 | Institutional research |
| PitchBook Insights    | Market commentary      |
| Crunchbase / Dealroom | Structured data        |

PitchBook Insights should **support narratives**, not supply numbers.

---

## 3. Allowed Crawl Scope (Hard Guardrails)

You should explicitly whitelist URLs like:

```text
https://pitchbook.com/news/*
```

And hard-block everything else:

```text
/premium
/research
/library
/benchmarks
/indexes
/dashboards
/login
```

Additionally:

* Stop crawling on **any auth redirect**
* Stop crawling on **PDF download prompts**
* Do not follow internal links beyond `/news`

This should be enforced at the crawler level, not by convention.

---

## 4. How PitchBook Fits Into Investor / FO Workflows

### What You Use It For

PitchBook Insights is useful for:

* Deal activity commentary
* Capital flow narratives
* Timing signals
* Sentiment shifts
* Secondary market commentary

Example use:

> “PitchBook notes a slowdown in late-stage VC exits in Q3…”

### What You Do NOT Use It For

Never extract:

* Deal counts as truth
* Valuations
* Fund performance numbers
* Benchmark statistics

Those require a license.

---

## 5. Investor-Grade Metadata Tagging (Important)

Every PitchBook-sourced document should be tagged explicitly:

```json
{
  "source": "PitchBook",
  "source_type": "Editorial / Commentary",
  "data_confidence": "Medium",
  "usage": "Contextual only",
  "license_sensitive": true
}
```

This protects you legally **and** increases trust with ICs and LPs.

---

## 6. How to Combine PitchBook With Your Other Sources

### Correct Synthesis Pattern

```
McKinsey / BCG → market size, structure
Big 4 → regulatory, operational context
PitchBook → capital flow narrative
Crunchbase / Dealroom → company-level facts
```

PitchBook becomes:

* A **qualitative overlay**
* A **trend confirmation layer**
* A **timing signal**, not a fact source

This mirrors how institutional teams actually operate.

---

## 7. Should You Crawl It at All?

**Yes, but narrowly.**

If you exclude PitchBook entirely, you lose:

* Fast-moving market commentary
* Secondary market color
* VC/PE sentiment framing

If you over-crawl it, you introduce:

* Legal risk
* Data contamination
* Institutional distrust

The middle path is correct.

---

## 8. Final Recommendation (Clear and Actionable)

**Include PitchBook like this:**

* Crawl `/news` only
* HTML pages only
* No PDFs
* No dashboards
* No numeric claims treated as ground truth
* Always secondary to consulting firms

**Never include:**

* Research Library
* Venture Monitor
* Benchmarks
* Indexes
* Tools

If you do this, your platform is:

* Legally compliant
* Institutionally credible
* Strategically stronger

### If you want next:

I can:

1. Define **exact URL allow/deny rules**
2. Design **source-weighting logic**
3. Add **PitchBook-specific NLP prompts**
4. Create a **compliance checklist** for FO use
5. Map this into an **IC memo workflow**

Tell me which one you want to lock in first.
